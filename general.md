# What's Different

Following are the major changes to this variant of the Dungeons and Dragons
v3.5 game.

## Playing the Game

### Exploding Dice
When rolling the max value on a die, re-roll and add the result of the rolls.
Subsequent rolls can also explode.

> Example:
> Noriam's short sword does 1d6+3 damage. He rolls 1d6 and gets a 6. Because
> this is the maximum value for a 1d6, he rolls again. This time he rolls a 4.
> He calculates his damage -- 6 + 4 + 3 -- and gets a 13.
>
> Rustless' longspear does 1d10 + 8 damage. He rolls a 1d10 and gets a 10.
> Rolling the 1d10 again, he gets another 10. Because subsequent rolls also
> explode, he rolls again and (miraculously) gets *another* 10. Finally, he
> rolls again and gets a 2. He calculates his damage -- 10 + 10 + 10 + 2 + 8 --
> and gets a 40.

In additions, weapons have special explosion rules. Whenever an attack roll is
naturally within the _threat range_ of the wielded weapon, the die explodes.

> Example
> Furio is wielding a longsword, whose threat range is 19-20. Furio makes an
> attack roll; the natural value of the d20 is 19. Because this is within the
> threat range of his weapon, he rolls a d20 again and this time gets a 7.
> Furio's attack bonus is +4. The value of Furio's attack roll is 19 + 7 + 4 = 30.

### Critical
Critical successes and critical hits occur whenever a roll of the d20 exceeds
the target number by 20.


## Abilities
Abilities are unchanged.

### Proposal: Simpler Stats
Why calculate ability bonuses?

We have ability scores, but we only ever use them for their bonuses. Why not
instead treat ability bonuses as the scores, modifying existing tables

### Proposal: Fewer Stats
What if there were fewer stats?

* (FIT): Fitness. Combines STR and CON.
* (DEX): Unchanged, because this is already the most over-powered stat.
* (MND): Mind. Intelligence, perception
* (PER): Charisma, willpower, intuition

Less bookkeeping, more obvious use of what each stat does, and each stat
becomes approximately equally important.

### Proposal: Simplify Saves
Why are saves class-based bonuses?

As an extension of "Fewer Stats": Each stat would each correlate to a type of
saving throw.

* FIT saves would replace FORT saves.
* DEX saves would replace REF saves.
* MND saves would be used to resist mind-affecting spells and effects.
* PER saves would be used for other WILL-type saves.
