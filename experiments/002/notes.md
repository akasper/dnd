# Notes

## Overview

### Reroll Initiative Every Round

The combat round is structured like this:

  1. All combatants refresh their maneuvers.
  2. Combatants re-roll initiative.
  3. Combatants act in order, allocating prowess when their turns begin.

### Rules of Order for Parry and Block

We also nailed down, with more precision, the rules or order for resolving
parries and blocks:

  1. The attacker declares his target and maneuvers. ("Aim" or "Hinder")
  2. The defender declares his parry or block.
  3. The attacker makes his attack roll.
  4. The defender makes his opposed roll.


### Maneuvers Refresh

* Combatants acting during a surprise round are granted all of their maneuvers.
* At the start of each round, combatants re-roll initiative.


### Critical Success

Critical success now comes when the roll exceeds the target number by 10 or
more. This is true of attack rolls as well.


### Enchantments

Prowess is expensive. Perhaps what used to be a +1 sword now grants +1 to
  Prowess?

The system also creates opportunites for more specialized enchantments. Weapons
might be associated with a particular maneuver -- parry or aim, for instance --
and


### Feats

  Some new feats:

  * _Improved Block_: If you successfully block an attack that targets you,
    before your next turn, you may make another block attempt against an attack
    that targets you at a cost of 0 maneuvers

  * _Improved Parry_: If you successfully parry an attack that targets you,
    before your next turn, you may make another parry attept against an attack
    that targets you at a cost of 0 maneuvers


### House Rules

  * During combat, players declaring actions quickly -- within 10 seconds of it
    being their turn -- might be granted a +1 bonus to d20 rolls.


### Card System

Suggestion: a card system for keeping track of maneuvers. Might also add a
  CCG-like system for managing available maneuvers?
