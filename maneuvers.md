# Maneuvers

A character has a number of maneuvers per round equal to 1 + (the greater of his
DEX and INT modifiers). All characters have at least one maneuver. Characters

equal to their DEX bonus.

# List of Maneuvers

### Aim
You focus on striking your opponent.

* It is your turn
* You are making an attack

You add 1d6 to your attack roll.

_Special_: You may use this ability multiple times in a single round. The bonus
applies only to a single attack, but each additional maneuver spent adds an
additional 1d6 to the attack.

### Attack of Opportunity
You find the perfect moment to strike an opponent.

* An enemy has prooked an attack of opportunity.

You may use 1 maneuver to take an attack of opportunity. This is the only
circumstance under which you may take an attack of opportunity.

_Special_: Characters with the Combat Reflexes feat may perform one attack of
opportunity per found without expending a maneuver to do so.

### Block
You deflect an incoming attack with a shield.

* You wield a shield or have the Unarmed Combat feat
* You (or an adjacent ally) are targeted by a non-touch attack

Make a block roll:

1d20 + Shield bonus + current defense bonus.

If your block roll exceeds the attack roll of the incoming attack, the attack
misses. Otherwise, resolve the attack normally.

_Special_: Characters with the Unarmed Combat feat may perform a block even if
they are not wielding a shield.

_Special_: Characters with the Shield Proficiency wielding a shield may perform
one block every round without expending a maneuver to do so. The blocker,
however, may only use this free block attempt against attacks that target
himself.

### Coordinated Sneak
You combine a cheap shot with an ally's attack to maximize damage.

* It is your turn
* You have the Sneak Attack ability

Make an attack roll against an opponent. If you hit, do no damage. Choose an
ally. For the next round, if your ally attacks your opponent, and the opponent
would be vulnerable to a sneak attack by you, your ally may add your sneak
attack dice to his damage rolls against the opponent.

### Dodge
You focus on preventing a single opponent from hitting you.

* It is your turn

Choose an opponent. For one round, you add an additional 1d6 to your defense
bonus for all attacks that opponent makes that target you. (Add these dice at
the time of the attack, and roll separately for each attack.) This bonus is
immediately negated if you are incapacitated or otherwise immobilized.

_Special_: You may use more than one maneuver to dodge a single opponent. Each
additional maneuver expended grants an additional 1d6 bonus to your defense.

_Special_: Characters with the Dodge feat may perform one dodge per round
without expending a maneuver to do so.

### Hinder
You limit an opponent's mobility by compromising his tactical position

* It is your turn

Make an attack roll against an opponent you threaten. If you hit, do no damage.
Instead, if the opponent moves more than one square during his next turn, you
may make another attack. If the attack succeeds, it it automatically a critical
hit.

### Parry
You deflect an incoming attack with your weapon.

* You are wielding a weapon
* An enemy you threaten targets you or an ally with a melee attack

Make a parry roll:

1d20 + current attack bonus

If your parry roll exceeds the attack roll of the incoming attack, the attack
misses. Otherwise, resolve the attack normally.

_Special_: Characters with the Combat Expertise feat may perform one parry every
round without expending a maneuver to do so. The parrier, however, may only use
this free parry attempt against attacks that target himself.

### Rapid Shot
You surrender precision with a ranged attack in favor or firing more rapidly.

* It is your turn
* You have the Rapid Shot feat
* You are attacking with a ranged weapon.

You make two ranged attacks, each at a -2 penalty.


### Rend
You use your off-hand weapon to push through an opponent's defenses.

* It is your turn
* You have the Two Weapon Fighting feat
* As part of an attack during your standard action, you have landed a hit with
your primary weapon, but have not yet rolled damage.
* You wield a melee weapon in your off hand

Make an attack roll with your off-hand weapon. If it hits, you may roll the
damage for your primary weapon and your off-hand weapon at the same time, and
treat them as a single attack for the purposes of penetrating resistance.


### Run
You focus on moving quickly at the expense of defense.

* It is your turn
* You have not yet moved

You may add an additional 1d6 squares to your movement. You take a -2 penalty to
your defense.

_Special_: You may use more than one maneuver on running. Each maneuver expended
yields an additional 1d6 squares of movement, and increases the penalty by an
additional -2.

_Special_: Characters with the Run feat add 1d8 instead of 1d6.


### Suppress
You limit passage through an area by covering it with ranged fire

* It is your turn
* You weild a ranged weapon or can cast a quickened ranged spell

As a full round action, you may select 1d6 contiguous squares within your line
of sight. Any opponent who passes through these squares for the next round
provokes an attack of opportunity from you.

_Special_: You may use more than one maneuver on supressing. Each maneuver
expended yields an additional 1d6 contiguous squares of coverage.

_Special_: You may combine this with the Aim maneuver. The bonus 1d6 to attack
rolls applies to all attacks of opportunity within the target area.


### Trap
You pin an opponent's shield, weapon or other wielded item.

* It is your turn
* You wield a melee weapon

Choose an item wielded by an opponent you threaten, such as a weapon, shield or
wand. Make an attack roll, opposed by your opponent's attack or defense bonus --
whichever is greater. If you succeed, the item cannot be used by the opponent
until your next turn (at which point you may opt to trap the item again), or
until they untrap it.

While you trap an opponent's weapon, you may not move, use any other maneuvers
or perform any other standard actions.

On his turn, the opponent has the following options:

* Drop: As a free action, the opponent may opt to drop the trapped item.
* Untrap: As a move action, the opponent may make an opposed attack roll
against you. (You receive a +4 bonus to your roll, because you have already
trapped the item. See below.). If the opponent wins the opposed test, he has
successfully untrapped the item.

_Special_: You receive a +4 bonus to your attack roll to trap if you are
attempting to trap an item you trapped during your last turn.
